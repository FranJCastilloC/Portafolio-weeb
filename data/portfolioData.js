      `In the field of manufacturing and quality control, Statistical Process Control (SPC) Analysis plays a crucial 
      role in identifying and correcting variations in production processes that can affect the quality of the final product. 
      Implementing SPC using SQL (Structured Query Language) allows organizations to analyze large volumes of production data
       with accuracy and efficiency. Using SQL, complex queries can be created that facilitate continuous monitoring of critical 
       process parameters, early detection of deviations outside established control limits, and identification of patterns that 
       indicate potential quality problems.`,

      The goal is to implement a more methodical approach known as statistical process control (SPC). SPC is an established strategy that uses
       data to determine whether the process is working well. Processes are only adjusted if measurements fall outside of an acceptable range. `,
